Apart from academics and research, I enjoy watching Formula 1 and Cricket.  I won't get into my favorite teams and drivers as I don't want to cause any arguments XD.
I am trained in the Indian Classical Music Instrument, Tabla. When I am at home, I enjoy occasionally spending hours playing the Tabla, either alone or in accompaniment to someone else.
I also occasionally play Basketball and Golf.
