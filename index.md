# Welcome to my website!
Hey everyone! I'm Anurag. I'm currently a Physics PhD student at Princeton University. 
I graduated from IIT Bombay in 2024 with a B.Tech. in Engineering Physics (With Honors) along with a Minor in Mathematics.

I have taken up quite a few projects across Active Matter and High Energy Physics here at IITB and have spent a fair bit of time exploring other fields as well. In my free time,  I enjoy playing the Tabla and watching F1.
